# Time Capsule 2026

A romantic, single-page time capsule made for my soulmate. It scrolls through past, now, and future chapters with a cinematic hero, interactive particles, and a midnight heart.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Optional: run a static server if you want cleaner asset paths.

## What is inside

- `index.html` - page content and structure
- `styles.css` - styling, layout, and animations
- `script.js` - particles, scene modal, and interactions
- `/img/` - image assets
- `favicon.svg` - favicon

## Customize

- Edit the copy directly in `index.html`.
- Replace images in `/img/` and update `background-image` references.
- Adjust colors and effects in `styles.css`.

## Notes

- The images in `/img/` are placeholders.
